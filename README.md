# euclid-algorithm-calculator
My personal Java project which automates the tedious process of calculating the greatest common divisor for the euclidian algorithm.

This can help you speed up the process of calculating the GCD, and it allows you to double check yourself.

I found it useful while studying Discrete Mathematics during my first year at University.
